# Galaxy-Image-Classification
  - Deep Learning Model that classifies galaxy images as either Elliptical(E), Spiral(S), or Barred Spiral(SB) with PyTorch library
  - Utilized Kagggle Zoo 2 Images Dataset
  - Developed in Google Colab and VS Code
  - Created frontend visualization for project using streamlit python library

  Dataset:
  - Refer to this [external link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxgtI3oDXed2ATKneyxCWz7C-uOAsV6R/view?usp=sharing) to view dataset used for this project
  - Also available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertmifsud/resized-reduced-gz2-images/data)
    
  To view Streamlit site on localhost:
  - Navigate to frontend.py
  - Ensure streamlit and other libraries used are installed (pip install streamlit, etc...)
  - Run command: "streamlit frontend.py"
  - Upload or drag in a galaxy image and see what the model predicts! (there is a test image called "galaxy.jpg" in files you can try)
